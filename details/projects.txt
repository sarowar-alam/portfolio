📌 AWS Security Group Open Ports Auditor 
August 2023 
Automated security compliance tool that continuously monitors AWS Security Groups across multiple regions to identify ports exposed to the internet (0.0.0.0/0). The system intelligently traces network topology (security groups → network interfaces → route tables → internet gateways), tests HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect functionality on port 80, maps exposed resources to their EC2 instances or load balancers, and automatically delivers professionally formatted Excel reports with color-coded headers and intelligent sorting to security teams via AWS SES email.

Manual Problems Solved
⏱️ Time: Eliminated 4 hours/week of repetitive manual security audits where analysts had to click through hundreds of security groups across multiple AWS regions
🐌 Detection Delay: Reduced from 30-90 days (quarterly audits) to <24 hours with automated weekly scans, catching misconfigurations before they become incidents
📊 Consistency: Standardized reporting format with automated Excel generation (previously ad-hoc spreadsheets with inconsistent columns and manual data entry errors)
🔍 Visibility: Automated resource-to-owner mapping by correlating security groups → network interfaces → EC2 instances with name tags, eliminating hours of manual investigation
🌍 Coverage: Multi-region scanning capability ensures 100% visibility (previously audits covered only one region at a time, missing critical exposures)
🔐 Validation: Automated HTTP redirect testing verifies port 80 properly redirects to HTTPS, ensuring web security best practices without manual browser testing
Value Added
$40K annual savings (eliminated 4 hrs/week × 50 weeks × $200/hr fully loaded security analyst cost)
95% faster detection of misconfigurations (4 hours → 5 minutes per audit cycle)
Weekly automated scans vs quarterly manual audits (12x increase in audit frequency)
100% coverage across all AWS regions and security groups (no blind spots)
Audit-ready compliance documentation with historical Excel reports for SOC2/ISO27001 evidence
Risk reduction: Proactive detection prevented potential security incidents that could cost $100K-$1M+ in remediation
Team productivity: Security analysts freed from repetitive tasks to focus on remediation and strategic security initiatives
Tech Stack & Architecture
Python 3.7+: Core automation logic with sophisticated error handling and logging frameworks
boto3 (AWS SDK): Multi-service API integration with retry logic
pandas: Data aggregation and transformation from multiple AWS APIs
openpyxl: Excel generation with professional styling, auto-sizing, and color formatting
socket: Low-level TCP connections for HTTP redirect validation
AWS Services: Multi-service orchestration with security best practices
EC2 APIs: DescribeSecurityGroups, DescribeInstances, DescribeNetworkInterfaces, DescribeRouteTables
SES: Raw email with MIME multipart attachments and HTML body
STS: AssumeRole for temporary credentials (1-hour expiry, automatic rotation)
IAM: Least-privilege roles with separation of concerns (scan vs email permissions)
CI/CD: Jenkins pipeline with Groovy DSL for scheduled execution, workspace cleanup, and error handling
Security Architecture: Multi-role IAM design with temporary session tokens (no static access keys), credential isolation between services
Network Analysis: VPC topology parsing to distinguish truly public resources from private subnet resources
Key Achievement
Solo-designed and built end-to-end automation covering the complete lifecycle: architecture design → IAM security model → AWS API integration → network topology analysis → HTTP protocol testing → data processing pipeline → Excel report formatting → email delivery infrastructure. Implemented enterprise-grade patterns including temporary credential rotation, separation of concerns across IAM roles, comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, and production-ready logging. Delivered measurable ROI with quantified cost savings and efficiency gains within first quarter of deployment.

Effort: ~80 hours from design to production deployment (2 weeks) with ongoing maintenance. Solo ownership of requirements gathering, architecture, development, testing, deployment, and operational support.

📌 Migration of SQL Server 2016 => SQL Server 2019

Sep 2023 – Sep 2023

For a client we did Migrate to SQL Server 2019. Client had the Databases of 3 different of his clients which includes more than 30 databases.
 In addition to that we need to migrate all scheduled jobs and maintenance cleanup and backup jobs.
 There were DTS package format versions job also there to migrate to SQL Server 2019.


 📌 Zabbix server upgrading from 3.x to Zabbix 5.0.37
 Oct 2023 – Oct 2023
For a Client this migration happen. Existing server version 3.2.3 to upgraded to Zabbix 5.0 with 60 hosts, more then 20 templates.


📌 Upgradation MongoDB server version: 4.2.3 => 6.09 with replicaset

Upgraded the MongoDB server version 4.2.3 to 4.4 then to 5 then to 6.09. It has the replica set with 3 MongoDB and one arbiter. We had to upgrade the DBs step by step and then set the setFeatureCompatibilityVersion from 4.2 to 4.4 to 5.0 to make it happen. 
Replica set need to redefine as to we had one arbiter which we moved out from the replica set.


Upgrade / migrate Amazon S3 Anitvirus fromOlder version to the current 2.15
Scan your S3 buckets for viruses, worms, and trojans. Powered by Sophos. bucketAV detects malware in real-time, periodically, on-demand, on-access, or via API. Your data never leaves your AWS account.



AWS Orphaned Snapshots Detector
Executive Summary

Production-grade cost optimization platform that autonomously identifies orphaned EBS snapshots across 8 AWS regions, delivering 15-30% reduction in snapshot storage costs and eliminating 8-10 hours/month of manual infrastructure auditing.

Business Problem & Solution
EBS snapshots accumulate as infrastructure evolves, creating forgotten storage assets incurring continuous costs. Engineered automated detection and reporting system that scans multi-region AWS infrastructure weekly, attributes orphaned resources to creators via CloudTrail forensics, and delivers actionable intelligence through formatted stakeholder reports.

Architecture & Key Decisions
Security-first multi-tier design: Dual IAM role pattern with temporary STS credentials (1-hour TTL) separating read-only scanning from email permissions—implementing zero-trust at architectural level. Set-based detection algorithm efficiently processes thousands of snapshots. CloudTrail event correlation enables ownership attribution with graceful degradation for aged data.

Delivery pipeline: Jenkins CI/CD with Groovy orchestration, scheduled weekly execution, automatic credential lifecycle management, and AWS SES integration for HTML reporting.

Technology Stack
Python 3.x + boto3, Groovy, Jenkins CI/CD, AWS services (EC2, CloudTrail, SES, STS, IAM). Comprehensive test suite with AWS mocking and local development harness.

Automation Impact
Eliminated manual process: Quarterly console-based audits requiring engineers to manually cross-reference snapshots against AMIs across regions, search CloudTrail logs, and compile stakeholder reports.

Achieved: Continuous weekly monitoring, 100% regional coverage, automatic creator attribution, zero manual intervention—transforming 8-10 hours/month of manual effort into 5-minute automated execution.

Ownership Scope
End-to-end individual delivery: requirements gathering with finance stakeholders, security architecture and IAM design, Python development, CI/CD engineering, AWS infrastructure configuration, production deployment, and comprehensive documentation (1,000+ lines) enabling team autonomy. Production system delivered concept-to-deployment in 6 weeks; currently executing weekly with minimal maintenance burden.


Executive Summary
Cost-Optimized ECS Auto-Scaling Platform

Designed and implemented an intelligent infrastructure automation system that reduces AWS compute costs by 70-90% for variable-demand workloads by automatically scaling ECS services to zero during idle periods. Eliminates manual intervention in capacity management while maintaining sub-minute response times to incoming work.

Architectural Approach: Event-driven dual-trigger design combining EventBridge scheduled polling with CloudWatch alarm-based shutdown. Ensures reliable 0↔1 task transitions without application code changes. Terraform modules deployed via Jenkins pipeline enable self-service adoption across multiple services using workspace isolation.

Engineering Decisions: Rejected single-trigger approaches and traditional auto-scaling (which requires ≥1 running task) in favor of bidirectional automation with built-in resilience. Start Lambda implements 4-check validation logic to prevent false positives; stop Lambda captures performance metrics pre-shutdown for capacity right-sizing analysis.

Technology Stack: Terraform (IaC), Python 3.12 Lambda functions, AWS ECS/Fargate, SQS, CloudWatch, EventBridge Scheduler, S3 state backend, Jenkins pipeline orchestration.

Automation Impact:

Eliminated manual on/off procedures requiring ~15 minutes per service daily
Reduced infrastructure operating cost from $35/month to $9/month per service
Enabled zero-touch deployment via parameterized Jenkins pipeline
Infrastructure overhead: ~$2/month (Lambda invocations, alarms, logs)
Ownership Scope: Full-stack delivery including infrastructure design, Terraform modules, Lambda development, CI/CD pipeline, IAM automation, comprehensive documentation (7 guides totaling 4,500+ lines), and production operations runbook. Documented 13 architecture decisions with trade-off analysis for knowledge transfer and maintainability.


Executive Summary: Automated Multi-Region AMI Backup Pipeline
System Purpose & Business Impact

Enterprise-grade disaster recovery automation for AWS infrastructure spanning three production environments across multiple AWS accounts and regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1). The system orchestrates zero-downtime backups of 12+ critical EC2 instances, eliminating manual intervention and reducing recovery time objectives from hours to minutes.

Architectural Approach

Event-driven automation pipeline leveraging Jenkins for orchestration and Python/Boto3 for cloud API integration. The solution implements a declarative configuration model where infrastructure teams maintain simple text-based instance inventories under version control, while the automation handles credential management, multi-account switching, error resilience, and comprehensive tagging for cost allocation and compliance.

Key Engineering Decisions

NoReboot Strategy: Implemented non-disruptive AMI creation to maintain 100% uptime during backup operations, critical for production workloads
Multi-Account Security Model: Architected secure credential vault integration with UUID-based mapping, eliminating hardcoded secrets and enabling seamless cross-account operations
Intelligent Error Handling: Built resilient execution flow that continues processing remaining instances when individual failures occur (duplicate AMI detection, invalid instance IDs), preventing single-point backup failures
Tag-Driven Governance: Automated application of 7 standardized tags (Owner, CostUnit, Environment, System, Client, CostApp) to both AMIs and snapshots for FinOps, compliance, and lifecycle management
Automation Impact & Operational Efficiency

Eliminated manual AMI creation workflow that previously required 30-45 minutes per environment and was error-prone. Engineers now execute scheduled or on-demand backups via parameterized Jenkins jobs in under 5 minutes with consistent naming conventions, comprehensive audit trails, and automatic cost tracking. The solution reduced pre-maintenance preparation time by 85% while increasing backup reliability and standardization across three business-critical client environments.

Scope of Ownership

End-to-end responsibility from design through production operation: pipeline architecture, Python automation development, multi-region AWS IAM configuration, Jenkins job implementation, and operational runbook documentation for 24/7 support teams.

Technology Stack: Jenkins (Groovy DSL), Python 3, Boto3 SDK, AWS EC2/EBS, Git, Multi-region cloud infrastructure

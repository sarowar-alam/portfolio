Project Title
Enterprise Multi-Cloud Backup Verification & Monitoring System

Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive automated backup verification system that monitors and validates 100+ backup entities across hybrid cloud infrastructure, ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery readiness for enterprise production environments.

Technical Details
Role: DevOps Engineer / Python Developer
Duration: Production System (2000+ lines of code)
Environment: AWS Multi-Account, Hybrid Windows/Linux Infrastructure

Key Responsibilities & Achievements
Architected and implemented an enterprise-grade backup monitoring solution that validates backup integrity across AWS S3, EC2 AMIs, Windows/Linux servers, and multiple database systems
Integrated multiple AWS services including S3, EC2, AWS Backup, and SES across multiple AWS accounts (JustFace, VMLYR, Zanity)
Automated verification of 15+ backup categories including S3 syncs, MongoDB backups, MySQL backups, SQL Server backups, ETL pipelines, and Crystal Reports
Implemented intelligent backup scheduling logic handling daily, weekly (Saturday), monthly (last Saturday), and yearly backup patterns
Developed remote server monitoring using Paramiko (SSH) for Linux servers and PowerShell remoting for Windows servers to validate log files and backup completion
Built dynamic date calculation system supporting 10+ date format patterns with timezone handling (Asia/Dhaka) for international operations
Technical Stack
Languages & Core Technologies:

Python 3.x (boto3, paramiko, BeautifulSoup4)
PowerShell for Windows server integration
JSON for configuration management
AWS Services:

EC2, S3, AWS Backup, SES (Simple Email Service)
Multi-region support (us-west-2, us-east-1)
Multi-account architecture with session tokens
Infrastructure:

SSH/Paramiko for Linux remote execution
Windows PowerShell remoting
Hybrid cloud environment (AWS + On-premises)
Key Features Implemented
S3 Object Validation - Automated detection of latest backup files with size and timestamp verification
AMI Backup Verification - Cross-references running EC2 instances against completed backup jobs
Log Pattern Matching - Intelligent log parsing with configurable patterns, date offsets, and match types
HTML Email Reporting - Color-coded success/failure reports sent via AWS SES to stakeholders
JSON-Based Configuration - 900+ line configuration file for easy maintenance and scalability
Multi-Account Support - Handles 4 different AWS accounts with separate credentials
Error Handling - Comprehensive exception handling for AWS errors, network failures, and authentication issues
Date Intelligence - Automatically calculates backup windows based on business rules (skips Sundays, special handling for Saturdays)
Business Impact
Reduced backup verification time from manual daily checks to automated 15-minute parallel execution
Increased reliability by catching backup failures within 24 hours
Improved compliance with automated audit trails and email reporting
Enhanced visibility for infrastructure team through detailed HTML reports
Supports disaster recovery planning with comprehensive backup validation
Technical Challenges Solved
Coordinated authentication across multiple AWS accounts with temporary session tokens
Handled mixed Windows/Linux environment with unified Python interface
Implemented pagination for AWS API calls to handle large resource sets
Managed complex date calculations for various backup schedules and timezones
Created reusable configuration system supporting 15+ backup pattern types

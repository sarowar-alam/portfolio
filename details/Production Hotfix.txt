Portfolio Title:
Multi-Server Production Hotfix Deployment Automation Pipeline

Project Description:
Engineered a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automating zero-downtime production hotfix deployments across multiple Windows servers. This solution eliminated manual deployment errors and reduced deployment time from hours to minutes while ensuring safe rollback capabilities.

Technical Implementation:

Designed Jenkins pipeline orchestration using Groovy with conditional stage execution
Developed PowerShell automation scripts for remote server management via PSSession
Integrated AWS S3 for centralized deployment package distribution
Implemented automated pre-deployment backup system with date-stamped versioning
Built multi-portal deployment support with selective targeting capabilities
Created comprehensive input validation and error handling mechanisms
Key Features:

Multi-Server Orchestration: Parallel deployment to multiple production servers
Selective Deployment: Choose between binary deployments, configuration updates, or both
Safety-First Design: Automated backup before any changes with rollback capability
AWS Integration: Downloads and extracts deployment packages from S3 buckets
Remote Management: PowerShell remoting with secure credential handling via Jenkins
Portal-Specific Configs: Maps and deploys environment-specific configuration files
Technologies Used:

Jenkins Pipeline (Groovy)
PowerShell 5.1+ with remoting
AWS S3 CLI
Windows Server administration
Git version control
Impact:

Reduced deployment time by 75%
Eliminated human error in production deployments
Enabled rapid hotfix rollout with built-in safety mechanisms
Standardized deployment process across all environments
